# Introduction

QANplatform is looking for developers contributing to developing the backend of a novel, openly accessible and truly free blockchain explorer called Librescan.

There is an eager need for a non-centralized, easily self-hostable & user friendly explorer, since while (most) blockchains are properly decentralized, 99% of users interact with them using completely centralized UIs.

The most often used type of such an evil UI is the block explorer itself.

Main issue is going 100% against blockchains' decentralization principles, as users are effectively associating all their valuable information (their wallet addresses, balances, owned token addresses etc.) with their IP addresses as soon as they make a lookup for them through such centralized explorers.

The goal is to give the blockchain community an easily self hostable solution making the UI part just as much decentralized as blockchains themselves are.

As a result data meant to kept private stays private indeed.
