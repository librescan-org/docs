# Infra engineers

Managing underlying infrastructure without inflicting direct user pain is a hard task to tackle.
For this very reason LibreScan makes this complication vanish as well by automating infrastructure creation by declarative means.

## Goal

Support as many possible infrastructure providers as possible.
Of course let's start with the most common ones like:

- Amazon AWS
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure

And also aim for the popular & trending choices like:

- Linode
- Hetzner
- Scaleway

## See whether this is something for you

If you can & enjoy building a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on bare metal using Terraform with a zero-config approach this is definitely your dream.

[Poseidon Typhoon](https://github.com/poseidon/typhoon) is the amazing work of [Dalton Hubble](https://github.com/dghubble) which walks you through creating such a cluster powered by [Fedora CoreOS](https://typhoon.psdn.io/fedora-coreos/bare-metal/). See whether you can make it happen and whether you enjoy the process!

## Choice of tooling

The choice here was straightforward, [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) really shines in this field.
It supports the vast majority of any possible deployment target as documented [here](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).
